This is a not-so-useful project that I made while learning the different tools used to create a Google Chrome Extension. The extension is called "Random Buttons" and only works on www.google.com. It manipulates the web page with programmatic JavaScript injections (such as adding elements and changing the page color). Very simple and basic extension.
