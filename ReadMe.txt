Random Buttons Chrome Extension 
Created by Brandon Ko

In this project, I explored and learned the different APIs that can be used to create a Google Chrome Extension. The extension only works on www.google.com. It manipulates the web page with programmatic JavaScript injections (such as adding elements and changing the page color). Very simple and basic extension.

-Version 1.1-
Touch up on some elements. Added a Webpage Elements section that allows users to append and remove nodes onto a specific element on the page. Added a Testing Button that is used to run specific tests.
